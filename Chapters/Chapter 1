Intro

The idea is to build a simple website from scratch just to figure out how the stuff work. I am going to use as little libraries as possibile.
I am going to start by building a simple RequestHandler class that inherits from the StreamRequestHandler from the SocketServer module.
Here is a little presentation how the stuff in the SocketServer module works.

Classes

BaseServer - its the parent class. It defines a few methods that mostly call the wrapped socket methods. TCPServer is the concrete implementation of this class. For every connection the server initiates a RequestHandlerClass and calls its handle method.

Our job is to write a class that inherit from the StreamRequestHandler and handle the request in the handle method.

ThreadingTCPServer and ThreadingUDPServer are the classes that reimlement the process method of the TCP/UDP server so that it initiates the requestHandler in a new thread.

ForkingTCPServer and ForkingUDPServer do the same but with a new process.

StreamRequestHandler and DatagramRequestHandler inherit from the BaseRequestHandler and are the different request handlers.
